Git training on GitHub

This is a recommitment to coding after a year and a half hiatus.  I have longed to dive into coding but have been gripped by fear and insecurity.  I didn't think that I could get it, code that is.  It was very hard for me in the coding bootcamp.  I passed and got a "good grade" but I really failed to learn and solidify any true coding skills.  This is my dream, I want to be a coder for life.  Now I have the opportunity to relearn and learn some more.  This time I really hope it sticks.  I'll be making time each day to code and develope my skill & knowledge.
